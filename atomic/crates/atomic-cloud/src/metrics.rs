//! Operational metrics for the cloud pod (scaling doc: "The recurring
//! remediation is monitoring").
//!
//! A hand-rendered Prometheus registry — ~20 gauges/counters, not a
//! framework, so no metrics crate. Each family maps to a named signal in
//! `docs/plans/atomic-cloud-scaling.md`:
//!
//! - account cache residency + evictions (#2: scan-vs-cache churn)
//! - dispatcher tick/full-scan durations and job counters (#2: tick summary)
//! - worker-pool in-flight vs cap (#8: bounded AI work)
//! - backup pass freshness and staleness (#6 and the launch-week stall)
//! - active export jobs (#5: exports share the data volume)
//! - control-pool and tenant-pool connection counts (#1: the 200-connection
//!   ceiling)
//! - process uptime + build stamp
//!
//! # Serving model
//!
//! The registry is a bag of atomics updated at the natural sites (dispatcher
//! tick end, backup pass end, worker settle); everything that is cheap to
//! read live (cache residency, pool sizes, in-flight counts) is sampled at
//! scrape time instead, so those gauges can never go stale. Every loop that
//! must keep happening (backup pass, staleness check, dispatcher tick and
//! full scan) additionally stores a unix stamp at its site and renders a
//! live age gauge at scrape — +Inf until the first event — because a dead
//! loop freezes its last-value gauges at a healthy reading, and only a
//! computed age makes that death alertable (see [`age_seconds`]). Request-path
//! metrics (per-request histograms, per-route latency) are deliberately OUT
//! of scope for this pass — they cost hot-path work per request and belong
//! to a later item; today's need is the background/ops signals a human
//! can't see without ssh.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! `/metrics` is served by a SEPARATE internal HTTP listener
//! (`--metrics-bind` / `ATOMIC_CLOUD_METRICS_BIND`, disabled when unset)
//! inside the same process. It is never registered on the public
//! tenant/app listener, so no route-table mistake, auth bug, or SPA
//! fallback can expose it to tenants — scrapers reach it over the docker
//! network only (`expose:`, never `ports:` in the compose file).
